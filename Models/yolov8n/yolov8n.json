        "description": "The YOLOv8 Nano model is a lightweight version of the YOLOv8 object detection model. It is designed for resource-constrained devices. Despite its smaller size, the YOLOv8 Nano model maintains a good balance between accuracy and speed. It uses a grid-based approach for object detection and has reduced layers and parameters compared to the original YOLOv8 model, resulting in faster inference times and lower memory requirements."
